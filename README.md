# Maze Runner
The application is named the Maze Runner. It emulates a "rat in a maze" scenario where the "rat" (starting from a specified entrance) escapes the maze, while its path is being traced. It is designed to show both shortest and longest paths the "rat" can take towards the exit.

# Side Notes
