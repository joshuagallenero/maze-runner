# Maze Runner
The application is named the Maze Runner. It emulates a "rat in a maze" scenario where the "rat" (starting from a specified entrance) escapes the maze, while its path is being traced. It is designed to show both shortest and longest paths the "rat" can take towards the exit.

The solution has 3 projects: MazeSolverQueue, MazeSolverStack and MazeSolverVisualizer. The algorithms for getting the shortest and longest paths are implemented on MazeSolverQueue and MazeSolverStack, respectively and can be tested through the console. The MazeSolverVisualizer is the WPF application where the user can interact with the GUI and create his/her own maze set-up.
